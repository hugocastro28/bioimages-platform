# Bioimages Platform

To understand the ecological impact of image production, from early analog photography to contemporary digital media, it is necessary to interpret complex relationships between materials, people, and processes over time and space. However, existing semantic data platforms often lack intuitive visual tools that can effectively support this exploration by non-technical users. 
This dissertation was developed within the scope of the Bioimages project, which explores how image-making affects the environment and society. It aims to address the challenge of how to present structured and time-evolving information in a visual, accessible, and engaging way that facilitates analysis and storytelling about the sustainability of images. The goal of this work is to propose and evaluate a web-based platform that supports the interactive visualization of entities and their connections across space and time. The system integrates semantic data from aWikibase and employs a map-based interface enriched with a timeline slider, semantic filters, and graph-based visualizations using React, D3.js, and React-Leaflet.
To validate the platform, an experimental protocol was conducted involving participants from the fields of art and design education. The evaluation was composed of a task-based usability testing and a System Usability Scale questionnaire. The results validated the conceptual validity of the proposed interface and demonstrated high task accuracy in direct exploration tasks. However, the study also identified areas for improving usability, specifically in the responsiveness of filters and the clarity of interactions. 
These findings support the use of graph-based, spatiotemporal visualizations as effective tools to explore rich and dynamic datasets, with potential applications extending beyond image ecology into other domains involving historical, cultural, or environmental data.

This project constitutes the prototype developed within the scope of the masterâ€™s dissertation.
